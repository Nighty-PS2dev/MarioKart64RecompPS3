  * Easy method for programmers and computers to understand each other which groups/separates bytes of information in a readable format.
  * Representing computer numbers as decimal results in an unreadable mess.
* `s32/word/int` - A max size for a number. Data represented as 32 bits or 4 bytes: `0x00000001`. It consists of eight digits.
* `s16/half-word/short` - A number represented as 16 bits or 2 bytes: `0x0001`. It consists of four digits. Maximum value 65,535 (0xFFFF).
* `s8/byte/char` - A number represented as 8 bits or 1 byte: `0x01`. It consists of two digits. Maximum value 255 (0xFF).
* `unsigned` - A positive integer. 0, 1 to maximum value.
* `signed` - A positive or negative integer. 0, -1 to -max, 1 to max.
  * Max value slightly lower than unsigned due to a bit being used to set whether negative or positive.
  * Google "Two's complement" for an indepth technical explanation.
* `f32/float` - A positive or negative value containing a decimals such as `5.0f` or `5.1f` or `5.148282f`
